Project : Exploratory data analysis on Car features and MSRP dataset

Objective :

The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the car dataset which includes features such as make, model, year, engine type to predict the price. To give a piece of brief information about the data set this data contains more of 10, 000 rows and more than 10 columns which contains features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more. So in this tutorial, we will explore the data and make it ready for modeling.

Key Activities :

1. Data Cleaning : Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistancies and missing values
2. Data Visualization : creating visulizations to understand data distributions, trends and relationships
3. Correlation Analysis : Identifying correlations between population figures and different years

Technologies Used :
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
